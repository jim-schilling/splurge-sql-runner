### 2025.5.0 (10-15-2025)

- **Migration (CLI)**
  - The CLI `main()` function now returns integer exit codes instead of calling `sys.exit()` directly.
    The distribution entrypoint still calls `sys.exit(main())`, so behavior for end users is unchanged.
  - New public constants are available from `splurge_sql_runner.cli`: `EXIT_CODE_SUCCESS`,
    `EXIT_CODE_FAILURE`, `EXIT_CODE_PARTIAL_SUCCESS`, `EXIT_CODE_UNKNOWN`.
  - Rationale: makes the CLI easier to call from tests and embedding programs without intercepting
    `SystemExit`.

- **CLI implementation and wiring**
  - `splurge_sql_runner.__main__` updated to propagate `main()` return codes via `sys.exit(main())`.
  - `cli_output.pretty_print_results` expectations clarified; tests aligned with the expected
    per-statement result dict shape.

- **Tests & coverage**
  - Added extensive unit tests for CLI behavior, flags, and edge cases (security guidance, partial-success
    path, flag parsing and variations).
  - Added and hardened tests for `sql_helper` (parsing, comment handling, CTEs) and for the
    `DatabaseClient` (mocked execution, row/rowcount handling, error/rollback behavior).
  - Reworked tests to be more robust: use `monkeypatch.setattr(sys, "argv", ...)`, tolerant assertions,
    and deterministic fixtures. Fixed a failing assertion in `tests/unit/test_result_models.py`.

- **Docs**
  - Updated `docs/cli/CLI-REFERENCE.md` with the exit-code migration note and clarified several flags
    (including `--continue-on-error` semantics).
  - Added `docs/api/API-REFERENCE.md` documenting `process_sql`, `process_sql_files`, and
    `parse_sql_file` (signatures, return shapes, exceptions, examples).

- **Tooling & quality**
  - Applied `ruff` formatting and fixes across tests and source where necessary.
  - Ran and validated `mypy` for the package (no typing errors reported after fixes).

- **Minor fixes**
  - Re-exported `parse_sql_file` from `splurge_sql_runner.main` to support tests and API consumers
    that import it from the `main` module.
  - Fixed several brittle test patterns and import-order issues revealed by `ruff`.

This release focuses on testability and maintenance: the behavior visible to CLI users is unchanged,
but the program is easier to integrate and assert against from programmatic callers and test suites.

### 2025.4.2 (09-03-2025)

- **Test Coverage**
  - Added focused unit tests for `utils.security_utils` covering `sanitize_shell_arguments` and `is_safe_shell_argument`

  - Inlined shell argument sanitization in `tests/run_tests.py` to avoid importing application code in E2E paths

  - Added `ruff` configuration and dependency; enabled checks (E, F, I, B, UP)
  - Enabled parallel test execution via `pytest-xdist` and default `-n auto`
