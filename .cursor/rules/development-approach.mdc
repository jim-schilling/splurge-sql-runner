- Follow SOLID, DRY, TDD, and MVP principles.
- Follow Research, Plan, and Implement lifecycle.
- Document research in docs/research-[yyyyMMddTHHmm].md.
- Document action plans in docs/plan-[yyyyMMddTHHmm].md.
- Plans shall detail requirements, testing strategy (i.e. TDD and BDD), and step-by-step implementation guide.
- Implementation lifecycle shall always: code failing tests, then implement code, then run tests, then iteratively refactor and run tests until all tests pass.
